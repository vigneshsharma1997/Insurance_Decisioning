  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Picture this. You are a data scientist in a start-up culture with the potential to have a very large impact on the
    business. Oh, and you are backed up by a company with 140 years' business experience. Curious? Great! You are the
    kind of person we are looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prudential, one of the largest issuers of life insurance in the USA, is hiring passionate data scientists to join a
    newly-formed Data Science group solving complex challenges and identifying opportunities. The results have been
    impressive so far but they want more.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated.
    Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling
    medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
  </p>
  <p>
    The result? People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance. Prudential
    wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining
    privacy boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, you can greatly
    impact public perception of the industry. The results will help Prudential better understand the predictive power of
    the data points in the existing assessment, enabling them to significantly streamline the process.
